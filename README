A sample repository to show the usage of EASTL types


Setup issues:

EASTL has an infinitely recursive submodule structure. In order to initialize at exactly the correct depth,
run :
git submodule update --init
cd EASTL
git submodule update --init


There's a strange CMake issue where cmake must be run twice in order to properly set everything up.
